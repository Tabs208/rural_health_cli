## Problem Discovery and Automation Concept
In rural areas of Kenya, the health sector faces challenges such as limited access to healthcare facilities, lack of timely medical advice, and inefficient communication between patients and healthcare providers. A Command-Line Tool (CLI) can automate core issues like patient triaging, health education, and appointment scheduling.

## Idea for the CLI Tool
Tool Name: RuralHealth CLI
A lightweight command-line tool designed for rural healthcare providers and community health workers to:
# Symptom Checker and Triage
Allows patients or health workers to input symptoms and receive triaging advice (e.g., whether the condition is urgent, moderate, or mild).
Offers actionable recommendations like "Visit the nearest clinic" or "Home remedies."
# Teleconsultation Booking
Enables booking appointments with remote healthcare professionals via SMS or email integration.
# Health Education Resources
Provides offline access to common health advice and tips for managing common diseases like malaria, cholera, etc.
# Supply Requests
Automates the request process for essential medical supplies from regional centers.
# Inconclusion
This tool simplifies teleconsultation for rural health workers. Learn more and download the tool on our [marketing website]https://tabs208.github.io/cli-marketing-website/
